# Nudge Coach
A hackathon project to assist users eager manage their health. The application is designed to move users towards healthier habits by designing a goal based on a user's wearable data and their health objectives. The program will check in with the user daily and using a variety of notifications based on the goal to keep them engaged. In the event the user fails to check-in the application will try to call the user.

To personalise the experience, the user can also select a personality to act as their coach which suits their style. The messages will be in the voice of that persona.
